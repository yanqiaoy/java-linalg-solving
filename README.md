# java-linalg-solving

In this project, weâ€™re going to write a simple linear algebra package linalg to define Vector and Matrix
classes and perform computations on them. When operations are illegal (e.g., indices out of bounds, matrix
multiplies with the wrong dimensions, etc.), the methods in this class should throw a linalg.LinAlgException).
